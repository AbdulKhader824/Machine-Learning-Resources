# Ensemble Methods: Bagging, Boosting, and XGBoost

Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve the overall performance compared to individual models. Two major categories of ensemble methods are **Bagging** and **Boosting**. In this guide, we will discuss Bagging, Boosting, and a popular implementation of Boosting, **XGBoost**.

## 1. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)

**Definition**:
Bagging is a parallel ensemble technique that aims to reduce **variance** by training multiple models on different subsets of the data (created using bootstrapping) and averaging their predictions (for regression) or voting (for classification).

### Key Points:
- **Parallel** method: Models are built independently.
- **Bootstrapping**: Each model is trained on a random sample (with replacement) of the training data.
- **Aggregation**: For regression, predictions are averaged; for classification, a majority vote is taken.
- Helps to reduce **overfitting** by reducing variance.

### Example Algorithm: Random Forest
- Random Forest is an extension of Bagging applied to Decision Trees. Each tree is trained on a bootstrap sample, and the final prediction is the majority vote or mean of all trees.

### Advantages:
- Reduces overfitting (lower variance).
- Works well with high-dimensional data.

### Disadvantages:
- Doesn’t necessarily reduce bias.
- Requires large computational resources.

## 2. Boosting

**Definition**:
Boosting is a sequential ensemble method that aims to reduce **bias** by training models in sequence, where each model attempts to correct the errors of the previous ones. It creates a strong learner by combining many weak learners.

### Key Points:
- **Sequential** method: Models are trained one after the other.
- Each new model is trained on the **residuals** (errors) of the previous models.
- Can improve both **bias** and **variance**.
- Models are often weighted based on their performance.

### Types of Boosting:
1. **AdaBoost**:
   - Adjusts the weights of misclassified points, giving more importance to those that are hard to classify.
   - Weak learners are typically shallow decision trees (stumps).
   - Final prediction is a weighted sum of all weak learners.

2. **Gradient Boosting**:
   - Sequentially adds models that predict the **residual errors** of the previous models.
   - Uses **gradient descent** to minimize the loss function.
   - Example: Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT).

3. **XGBoost**:
   - An efficient implementation of Gradient Boosting.
   - Adds **regularization** to control overfitting.
   - Highly efficient and scalable.

## 3. XGBoost

**Definition**:
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized implementation of gradient boosting that includes various enhancements, such as regularization, to improve both the performance and computational efficiency of the algorithm.

### Key Features:
- **Regularization**: Prevents overfitting by controlling the complexity of the model.
- **Handling missing data**: Automatically learns the best way to handle missing data.
- **Built-in cross-validation**: Can handle early stopping based on validation set performance.
- **Highly efficient**: Takes advantage of parallel processing and optimized data structures.

### Advantages:
- Outperforms many other algorithms in predictive tasks.
- Highly scalable to large datasets.
- Regularization prevents overfitting.

### Disadvantages:
- Complex to tune (many hyperparameters).
- Computationally expensive for very large datasets.

## Comparison: Bagging vs Boosting

| Feature                   | Bagging                  | Boosting                     |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                | Reduce variance          | Reduce bias                   |
| **Model Training**         | Parallel (independent)    | Sequential (dependent)        |
| **Focus on**               | Building strong models by reducing model variance | Correcting the errors of previous models |
| **Examples**               | Random Forest            | AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting   |
| **Strengths**              | Less prone to overfitting, works well with high-dimensional data | Better accuracy, handles bias well |
| **Weaknesses**             | Doesn’t address bias issues | Can overfit if not tuned properly |

## Mathematical Overview

### 1. Bagging (Random Forest)
Given a dataset \( D = \{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^N \), Bagging works by:

1. Generating **B bootstrap** samples \( D^*_b \) from \( D \), where \( b = 1, 2, ..., B \).
2. Training **B weak models** \( h_b(x) \) on each bootstrap sample \( D^*_b \).
3. Aggregating the predictions:
   - For regression: 
     \( \hat{y} = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B h_b(x) \)
   - For classification: 
     \( \hat{y} = \text{majority vote of } h_b(x) \)

### 2. Boosting (Gradient Boosting)
Gradient Boosting minimizes the loss function \( L(y, \hat{y}) \) by building weak models sequentially:

1. **Initial model** \( f_0(x) \):
   \( f_0(x) = \arg\min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^N L(y_i, \theta) \)
2. **Residual calculation** at each step \( m \):
   \( r_i^{(m)} = y_i - f_{m-1}(x_i) \)
3. **New model** \( h_m(x) \) fits the residuals, and update the final model:
   \( f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) + \lambda h_m(x) \)
   where \( \lambda \) is the learning rate.

### 3. XGBoost
XGBoost extends Gradient Boosting with additional regularization:
\( L(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^N L(y_i, \hat{y}_i) + \Omega(f) \)
where \( \Omega(f) \) is the regularization term to penalize model complexity.
